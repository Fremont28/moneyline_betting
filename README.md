The aim off this project is to calculate the expected value for the favorite and underdog in a matchup between two teams. At its simplest, expected value in sports betting is a way to measure the probability gap between a bettor’s expectations- and the sportsbook’s. For reference, a positive expected value (+EV) implies a profit overtime, while a negative value (-EV) implies a loss over time.  

The version of this code runs in Python3.
